# TODO: Make Photowalaa Website Fully Responsive

## Step 1: Enhance Custom CSS with Media Queries
- Add media queries for hero background grid adjustments on small screens.
- Adjust animation speeds and sizes for mobile.
- Make modal responsive (max-width, padding).
- Optimize video and photo card layouts for tablets.
- Ensure scroll animations work on touch devices.

## Step 2: Update HTML Classes for Better Responsiveness
- Add more breakpoint classes (e.g., xl:, 2xl:) where needed.
- Adjust padding, margins, and text sizes for small screens.
- Ensure grids and flexboxes wrap properly on narrow devices.
- Optimize navigation menu and form inputs for touch.

## Step 3: Prevent Overflow and Improve Readability
- Use responsive units (vw, vh, rem) instead of fixed px where possible.
- Add overflow handling for long text or images.
- Ensure consistent spacing across breakpoints.

## Step 4: Test Responsiveness
- Open in browser and resize window.
- Use developer tools to simulate mobile/tablet.
- Check for horizontal scroll, overlaps, and scaling issues.
